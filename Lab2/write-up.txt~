Write-up

Newton-Raphson method
This method takes 6 iterations to reach within epsilon(1e-6) distance of the root.

Secant method
This method takes 7 iterations to reach within epsilon(1e-6) distance of the root. As we know, the rate of convergence of the secant method is less than the Newton's method(1.618 against 2) This extra step is justified.

The New method
This method is even faster than the Newton's method. It takes only 4 step to reach the root when starting point is 1.
But there is an ambiguity. This method is highly unreliable and depends on the initial point for its rate of convergence.
When the initial point = 0, the method takes 156 iterations!
