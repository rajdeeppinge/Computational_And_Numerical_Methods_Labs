The user defined parameters for the newton raphson method were the starting point of x and the error tolerance epsilon.

When we ran the loop for a hundered times and checked with starting points as 1,-1,0.5 after a certain number of iterations namely 27,
the given ratio became a constant because the method converges approximately to the root.
