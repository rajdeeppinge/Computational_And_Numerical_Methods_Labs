The splines were generated using the fact that function value and spline values must agree at the data points and the continuity
conditions that the first and second derivatives of the function and the spline must agree at the interior points.

Actual answer f(0.5) = 0.0625

For the cubic case, 
	f(0.5) = 0.3125 with natural boundary condition.
	f(0.5) ~ 0 with clamped boundary condition.

For the quadratic case,
	f(0.5) = 0 with natural boundary condition.
	f(0.5) = 0.3750 with clamped boundary condition.

In Quadratic case, the accuracy is more with the natural boundary condition.
In Cubic spline, the accuracy is more with the clamped boundary condition.
