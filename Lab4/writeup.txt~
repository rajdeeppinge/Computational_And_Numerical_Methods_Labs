q1. We have written this programme in Matlab

Here we approximate the exponential function by a fourth order polynomial.
For the given range the polynomial very nearly approximates the exponential function.

The range of error is approximately 1e-3

When we increase the range from -5 to 5 we can see the huge error in approximation which implies that the interpolation is done for the localized functions.

The comparison between the two approximating polynomial Lagrange and Taylor shows that the Lagrange polynomial gives more accurate answer over the given range.
In case of Taylor polynomial, the answer is very close in the range [-0.5,0.5] but deviates outside that bound.


q2. We have written this programme in C

We have values of X and y(X)
We find the first, second and third divided difference for the given values.
We put these values in the divided difference polynomial to find the value of P(1.65).

Check: We also checked the value of P(1.65) by taking the midpoint of P(1.6) and P(1.8) i.e. P(1.7) and then taking midpoint of P(1.7) and P(1.6)
Both this value and the actual answer are very close indicating the correctness of method
