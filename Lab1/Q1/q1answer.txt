The user defined parameters for the newton raphson method were the starting point of x and the error tolerance epsilon.

When we ran the loop for a hundered times and checked with starting points as 1,-1,0.5 after a certain number of iterations namely 27,
the given ratio became a constant because the method converges approximately to the root. The method converges very well to the root in as little as
27 iterations and very close to the actual root so much so that the c datatype was underflowed. When we tried for x_init= 5 the method was unable to converge.
