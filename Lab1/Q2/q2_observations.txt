Observations

Newton-Raphson method converges to the root in 3 iterations.
Bisection method takes 20 iterations to converge to the root.
This shows that Newton-Raphson method is much faster than bisection method.

Another observation
I we increase the initial interval in the bisection method to [-100, 100] then also it converges to the root
This shows that Bisection method is globally convergent.
