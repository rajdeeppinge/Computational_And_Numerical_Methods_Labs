Q1

To find f'(6.0), we use forward difference method because 6.0 is the first point and we have maximum delta values available which will give better answer
f'(6.0) = -7.549167

To find f''(6.3), we use backward difference method because 6.3 is the last point and we have maximum nabla values available which will give better answer
f''(6.3) = -0.347100



Q2

step size		actual answer	method 1 approx ans		method 1 approx ans		method 1 approx ans
h = 0.100000, fdd = 99.500000, fddapprox1 = 64.189919, fddapprox2 = -8.654803, fddapprox3 = 75.784938
h = 0.050000, fdd = 99.500000, fddapprox1 = 88.144970, fddapprox2 = 32.629552, fddapprox3 = 96.125423
h = 0.025000, fdd = 99.500000, fddapprox1 = 96.471161, fddapprox2 = 73.470795, fddapprox3 = 99.076725
h = 0.012500, fdd = 99.500000, fddapprox1 = 98.730629, fddapprox2 = 90.614054, fddapprox3 = 99.483314
h = 0.006250, fdd = 99.500000, fddapprox1 = 99.306895, fddapprox2 = 96.300793, fddapprox3 = 100.288141

Here we observe that as the step size decreses the approximation gets closer to the actual answer.
