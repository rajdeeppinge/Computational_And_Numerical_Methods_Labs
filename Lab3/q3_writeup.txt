This is the analytical Gaussian elimination method. 
For a system of 3 equations and 3 unkowns using elimination
the value of one variable can be computed by systematically 
eliminating the other variables from the 3 equations.
Once, this value is obtained, the problem reduces to 
2 equations in 2 variables. Which can be solved by further 
gaussian elimination.

Since this is an analytical method, it will give exact solution.
We had to hard code the equations and the processor was essentially
used as just a calculator.
