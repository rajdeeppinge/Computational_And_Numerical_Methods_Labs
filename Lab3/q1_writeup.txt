This program is the implementation of the generalized Newton's method to solve a system of equations. We have a 
system of two equation in 2 variables x,y. 

We manually calculated the 2*2 jacobian and its inverse. It was simple since the dimension was small, in general
it will need a code for matrix multiplication which is not trivial to implement. The iteration rule is
to update vector by subtracting the multiplication of inverse jacobian and the vector of function values. We have
split this implementation in x and y since we have only 2 variables.  

Result : x = 2.000002 and y = 0.999998. This is for 4 iterations. For futher iteration x and y converge to 2.
