Q1.
	We get same value for x=0.15 by both forward and backward interpolation.

Q2.
	we find f(-0.9) by both forward and difference interpolation. The difference is 0.000001 which is negligible. This proves the case that answer is same by both the methods if the point is within the range.
	

Forward diffference for first five points
Backward difference for last five points

for x = -0.9
	Newton's forward difference method: solution = 0.406565
	Newton's backward difference method: solution = 0.490669
	Actual Answer = 0.406
Here, the forward difference method is better since x is in the range where forward difference method has been applied.

for x = 0.9
	Newton's forward difference method: solution = 2.417729
	Newton's backward difference method: solution = 2.459620
	Actual Answer = 2.459
Here, the backward difference method is better since x is in the range where backward difference method has been applied.
